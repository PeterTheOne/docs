# ðŸš° Constant Flow Agreement (CFA)

## Definition

The Constant Flow Agreement enables the _streaming of tokens_. Streaming refers to value transfer through a constant by-the-second movement of tokens from a sending party's account to a receiving party's account. In a CFA, the sending party agrees to have its account balance reduce at a certain per-second rateâ€”called the flow rateâ€”and the receiving party's account balance increase at that flow rate starting at the time of initiation. Through this agreement, a CFA produces a perpetual by-the-second movement, or "flow", of tokens that can be created, updated, or deleted at an account's discretion.&#x20;

## **Terminology**

* **Flow**: The per-second rate at which a sender agrees to decrease its netflow and increase a receivers netflow when initiating or modifying a CFA.&#x20;
* **Netflow**: The rate at which an account's Super Token's balance is changing. It is the sum of the account's inbound and outbound CFA flows.
* **Sender**: The account that initiates the CFA by specifying a receiver and a flow rate after which its netflow rate decreases.
* **Receiver**: The account on the receiving end of a CFA which increases its netflow rate.
* ****[**CRUD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,\_read,\_update\_and\_delete) **timestamp**: The timestamp of when an account is engaged in a CFA creation, update, or deletion.
* **Dynamic Balance**: The amount the account's Super Token balance has changed since the latest CRUD timestamp. Can be positive or negative.
* **Static Balance**: The Super Token balance of the account at the latest CRUD timestamp.&#x20;
* **Current Balance**: The actual Super Token balance of an account. It is the sum of the static balance and the dynamic balance.

**NOTE**: While the flow rate is always per-second, it may at times be mentioned on different cadences. For instance, a flow rate of "100 USDCx/mo." does not mean 100 USDCx is going to move accounts on a monthly cadence. This is simply a reframing of the rate: a 100 USDCx/month flow rate is really a \~0.0039 USDCx/second flow rate.
{% endhint %}

## Computation

By netting all inbound and outbound flow rates an account has, the netflow rate can be computed for each account.

When an account is engaged in a CFA creation/update/deletion, several things are recorded to the Superfluid CFA smart contract:

1. The new netflow rate&#x20;
2. The CRUD timestamp
3. The Static Balance (the Current Balance at the CRUD timestamp)

The account's balance will begin changing from this static balance figure based on the new net flow rate. This second-by-second growing delta from the static balance is the "dynamic balance" component which is computed as seconds elapsed since the last CRUD timestamp multiplied by the account's netflow rate.

The "dynamic balance" component can be positive or negative. The user's current balance will be determined by the sum of the dynamic balance and static balance.

**NOTE**: Because the only changing variable involved is time, creating a CFA is a one-time action. Viewing your balance is simply a matter of querying the value from the formula below and **NOT a matter of the sender or Superfluid running transactions every second to update balances**.

## Example - Monitoring Account A's Current Balance

This example section will break down the basic mathematics behind CFA actions by describing the action, visualizing the flow changes, and calculating the new statuses.

#### **1. With no initial CFA engagement and an initial balance of 1000 USDCx, Account A starts an outbound CFA to Account B with flow rate of 0.01 USDCx/second and 1000 seconds elapse**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png>)

Latest CRUD [timestamp](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/) = 1653400000 (Tue May 24 2022 19:20:24 GMT+0000)

Current timestamp = 165340**1**000

Static Balance = 1000 USDCx

Dynamic Balance = -0.01 USDCx/second \* 1000 seconds = -10 USDCx

Current Balance = 1000 USDCx + -10 USDCx = <mark style="color:green;">**990 USDCx**</mark>

#### **2. On the 1000th second, Account A increases the flow rate to Account B to 0.02 USDCx/second. The CFA contract records new status.**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png>)

Latest CRUD timestamp = 165340**1**000 ( recorded to CFA contract )

Current timestamp = 165340**1**000

Static Balance = <mark style="color:green;">**990**</mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;"></mark> <mark style="color:green;"></mark><mark style="color:green;">**USDCx**</mark>** ** ( recorded to CFA contract, takes the Current Balance value from 1. )

Dynamic Balance = -0.02 USDCx/second \* **0** seconds = 0 USDCx ( time elapsed has reset )

Current Balance = 990 USDCx + 0 USDCx = **990 USDCx**

#### **3. **_****_** Another 2000 seconds elapse**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (32).png>)

Latest CRUD timestamp = 165340**1**000

Current timestamp = 165340**3**000

Static Balance = 990 USDCx

Dynamic Balance = -0.02 USDCx/second \* **2000** seconds = -40 USDCx

Current Balance = 990 USDCx + -40 USDCx = <mark style="color:green;">**950 USDCx**</mark>

#### **4. On the 2000th second, Account A begins receiving an inbound CFA with flow rate of 0.04 USDCx/sec from Account C. The CFA contract records new status.**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png>)

Latest CRUD timestamp = 165340**3**000 ( recorded to CFA contract )

Current timestamp = 165340**3**000

Static Balance = <mark style="color:green;">**950 USDCx**</mark> ( recorded to CFA contract, takes the Current Balance value from 3. )

Dynamic Balance = **+0.02** USDCx/second \* **0** seconds = 0 USDCx

Current Balance = 950 USDCx - 0 USDCx = **950 USDCx**

#### **5. **_****_** Another 1000 seconds elapse**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (39).png>)

Latest CRUD timestamp = 165340**3**000

Current timestamp = 165340**4**000

Static Balance = 950 USDCx

Dynamic Balance = **+0.02** USDCx/second \* **1000** seconds = 20 USDCx

Current Balance = 950 USDCx + 20 USDCx = <mark style="color:green;">**970 USDCx**</mark>

#### **6. **_****_** Account A deletes the outbound flow of 0.02 USDCx/sec to Account B. The CFA contract records new status.**

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (38).png>)

Latest CRUD timestamp = 165340**4**000 ( recorded to CFA contract )

Current timestamp = 165340**4**000

Static Balance = <mark style="color:green;">**970 USDCx**</mark> ( recorded to CFA contract, takes the Current Balance value from 5. )

Dynamic Balance = **+0.04** USDCx/second \* **0** seconds = 0 USDCx

Current Balance = 970 USDCx + 0 USDCx = **970 USDCx**



## Solvency and Sentinels

What happens when an account's balance hits zero? When an account with a negative net flow rate reaches a zero balance, it is deemed **critical**. Given the nature of public blockchain technology, a CFA cannot cancel itself once zero balance is reached. Superfluid deals with this through **buffer deposits** and **Sentinels**.

### Buffer

When a stream is opened, an account must deposit a certain amount of Super Token for their stream as a cushion in case they hit critical. If an account cancels outbound streams before going critical, it will be refunded its buffer.&#x20;

When an account goes critical, Super Tokens can no longer be streamed from the account's balance (because there are none), so Super Tokens from the buffer are used to continue the account's outbound stream(s) until external accounts (Sentinels) step in and cancel them.

The remainder of the buffer is rewarded to the Sentinel that closes the stream (**note:** this is what happens in most cases, you can read about other liquidation rules [here](../../../sentinels/liquidations-and-toga.md)). This "liquidation" mechanism incentivizes accounts to close their streams before running out of tokens. It is an account owner's own responsibility to close their streams before reaching critical in order to avoid loss of the buffer.

The size of the buffer deposit is based on time and flow rate. So for instance, on Polygon, a **4-hour buffer deposit** is taken on streams. So if you are streaming at a rate of 10 USDCx/hour, then a 40 USDCx deposit will be taken.

### Sentinels

Superfluid enables the liquidation of critical account streams by any external account. Anyone can run Sentinel software which monitors all Constant Flow Agreements across the network, identifies critical accounts, and closes their streams, thereby earning buffer deposits.&#x20;
