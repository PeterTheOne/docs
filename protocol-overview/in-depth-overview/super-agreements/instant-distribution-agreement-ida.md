# âœ³ Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA)

## **Definition**

Traditionally, in order to transfer amounts from one sending account to many receiving accounts on the basis of established proportions, one would have to iterate across each desired recipient account and engage individual transfers of varying amounts. This is not scalable as gas costs rise incrementally with each transfer. The IDA accomplishes this one-to-many dispersion with a fixed gas cost making multi-recipient token distributions scalable.&#x20;

With an IDA, the sender (or "publisher") publishes an IDA index, which is a channel through which the distribution occurs. After creating the index, the publisher can issue distribution shares (or "units") for the index to individual receivers (or "subscribers"). The publisher can then distribute Super Tokens through the index and each subscriber will instantly receive tokens in proportion to the amount of units they possess relative to the total outstanding units.&#x20;

## **Terminology**

* **IDA Index**: A channel created by an account (the publisher) to distribute Super Tokens to any amount of receivers on a proportional basis.&#x20;
* **Distribution**: Pulls the specified amount of Super Tokens from the sender's account and distributes them to all receivers.
* **Units**: Dictate the proportion of Super Tokens distributed through an index that a subscriber is to receive. They are effectively distribution _shares_. Receivers receive Super Tokens sent through the IDA index in proportion to the units issued to them divided by total units issued for the index.&#x20;
* **Publisher**: The sender. Creates the IDA index and issues units to receivers
* **Subscribers**: The receivers. Accounts that are given units to an IDA index and are able to receive Super Tokens distributed through it.

**NOTE**: Instant Distribution Agreements are NOT one-and-done; they do not reset after a distribution is triggered. Each receiver's units for the index will persist across distributions, so the sender can continue to distribute through the index as many times and in various amounts as desired. A receiver's units can be increased or decreased as the sender sees fit.
{% endhint %}

## **Computation**

After publishing an index, a publisher can begin issuing units to subscribers. A subscriber's share of Super Tokens distributed through the index is equal to amount of shares owned divided by total amount of shares issued.

When a distribution is called, the publisher's Super Token balance falls by the total distribution amount while the receivers' balances rise by the transfer amount multiplied by the fraction of the total outstanding distribution shares they each respectively own.

## **Formula**:

Calculating the current balance of an account subscribed to one or many IDA Indices.&#x20;

**NOTE:** Accounts are not limited to publishing one index; they are able to concurrently own and utilize multiple indices, each with their own unique subscriber proportions. Likewise, subscribers can be subscribed to multiple indices at once.

## **Example - Account A's IDA Index**

**1. Account A publishes an IDA Index**

**2. Account A issue's **_**5**_** units to Account X, **_**10**_** units Account Y, and **_**15**_** units to Account Z.**

**3. Account A distributes 500 USDCx through the IDA Index**

**4. Account A updates Account Z to **_**10**_** units**

**5. Account A distributes 500 USDCx through the IDA Index**
