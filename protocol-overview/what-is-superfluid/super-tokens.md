# ðŸ¦¸â™€ Super Tokens

## Introduction

At this point, you are familiar with the concept of upgrading an ERC20 token to Super Token. The [Superfluid Dashboard](https://app.superfluid.finance) is a great tool for performing upgrades. Rather than spend time learning how to perform an upgrade, we will learn how to use the token super powers like _batching_ and _ERC777 callbacks_.

Just to recap from earlier, Super Tokens have a new token address after an upgrade. To denote this, we just append "x" to the token symbol.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial you should:&#x20;

* Complete the [@superfluid-finance/js-sdk](../../resources/archived-tutorials-docs/frontend-+-nodejs.md) tutorial
* Have some goerli ETH and tokens in your wallet from the dashboard [https://app.superfluid.finance](https://app.superfluid.finance)

## ERC777 Callbacks

Tokens which can "react" to certain events using callbacks [erc777.org](https://www.erc777.org).&#x20;

## **Batch Call**&#x20;

All Super Tokens include the **batchCall** feature, which allows you to perform multiple tasks in a single transaction.&#x20;

You can even mix-n-match your tasks, including upgrade/downgrade, calling agreements (CFA, IDA, etc), execute Super App functions, and make simple transfers. The world is your Oyster!
