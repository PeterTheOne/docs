# Batch Call Resources

## **Batch Call**&#x20;

All Super Tokens include the **batchCall** feature, which allows you to perform multiple tasks in a single transaction.&#x20;

You can even mix-n-match your tasks, including upgrade/downgrade, calling agreements (CFA, IDA, etc), execute Super App functions, and make simple transfers. The world is your Oyster!
