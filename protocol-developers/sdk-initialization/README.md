# ðŸ§¨ SDK Overview

The **SDK-Core** is an application framework for interacting with the Superfluid Protocol without Solidity knowledge. You can find it in the NPM library [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@superfluid-finance/sdk-core), and check out the complete README[ here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/blob/dev/packages/sdk-core/README.md). If you're interested in building high performance, production grade front end products on top of Superfluid, you should also consider using the **SDK Redux**, which serves as a wrapper around the SDK Core for applications which make use of Redux. You can find the SDK Redux on NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@superfluid-finance/sdk-redux), and the complete README [here](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo/tree/dev/packages/sdk-redux).&#x20;

> NOTE: More documentation on the SDK Redux is coming soon.

You can find reference docs for both of our SDKs at the following two links:

* [SDK Core Reference Docs](https://refs.superfluid.finance/sdk-core)
* [SDK Redux Reference Docs](https://refs.superfluid.finance/sdk-redux/)

The Superfluid SDK-Core is a wrapper library around `@superfluid-finance/ethereum-contracts` which allows web developers to interact with the Superfluid contracts. Under the hood, SDK-Core leverages TypeScript, ethers.js and The Graph and GraphQL.
