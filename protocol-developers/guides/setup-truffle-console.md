# Truffle Console

**In this tutorial we will**:

* Use `@superfluid-finance/js-sdk` in the truffle console with goerli testnet
* Mint Superfluid DAI (DAIx)
* Check Super Token balances&#x20;

## Installation

Download the example repo, which includes the Superfluid JavaScript software development kit.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/superfluid-finance/protocol-monorepo
yarn install
yarn build
```

If you haven't already, install truffle and jq.

```bash
npm i -g truffle

# Linux
sudo apt-get install jq
# Mac
brew install jq
```

### Obtain goerli ETH

Before we can get testnet ETH, we need a 12-word mnemonic to create some test wallets. If you don't have a mnemonic, we can use Truffle to create one.

```
truffle develop

> Accounts:
> (0) 0x627306090abab3a6e1400e9345bc60c78a8bef57
> (1) 0xf17f52151ebef6c7334fad080c5704d77216b732

> Mnemonic: rigid cradle south ...
```

Copy the first address and use one of the GÃ¶rli testnet faucets listed at [https://goerli.net/](https://goerli.net) to obtain some ETH. You can also add it to MetaMask, but please don't use it for mainnet / real tokens! If you opt for the MetaMask method, our [dashboard ](https://app.superfluid.finance)will also send you testnet ETH when logging in.&#x20;

Now exit from truffle develop, and create a file named `.env` in `packages/ethereum-contracts.` Add the mnemonic you just created, and your web3 provider URL for goerli test network.

```
cd packages/ethereum-contracts 
cp .env.template .env

# Add your details
GOERLI_MNEMONIC=rigid cradle south ...
GOERLI_PROVIDER_URL=https://goerli.infura.io/v3/<API_KEY>
```

## Truffle console

We are ready to open the Truffle console. You should be in `packages/ethereum-contracts` next to your `.env` file for this step.

```bash
npx truffle --network goerli console
```

Let's load the SDK and initialize it with the contracts.

```javascript
SuperfluidSDK = require("@superfluid-finance/js-sdk")

sf = new SuperfluidSDK.Framework({version: "v1", web3, tokens: ["fDAI"] })

await sf.initialize()

chainId 5

fDAIx: ISuperToken .tokens["fDAIx"] @0xF2d68898557cCb2Cf4C10c3Ef2B034b2a69DAD00
```

> What just happened? The Superfluid SDK used the `resolver` contract deployed on goerli to fetch all the Superfluid contracts for the version "test". Then the contract objects were created using the Truffle artifacts in the `/build` folder. Make sure you are using the latest _version_ name!

For this tutorial, we'll be using _fake_ ERC20 tokens called fDAI. If you need more than one token, you can easily add fUSDC and fTUSD as parameters when creating the sf object.

> Superfluid SDK created a Truffle object for our test token, and its superToken wrapper, at _sf.tokens.fDAI_ and _sf.tokens.fDAIx_

Now we'll load a web3 utility library `@decentral.ee/web3-helpers` and create easy-to-use aliases for our wallet addresses and tokens.

```javascript
const {
  toWad,
  toBN,
  fromWad,
  wad4human
} = require("@decentral.ee/web3-helpers");

const dai = await TestToken.at(sf.tokens.fDAI.address);
const daix = sf.tokens.fDAIx;

bob = accounts[0];
alice = accounts[1];
dan = accounts[2];
carol = accounts[3];
```

### Mint some DAIx (Superfluid DAI)

> If you used MetaMask and the Superfluid Dashboard with this wallet, then your should already have some DAIx tokens. You can skip ahead to checking balance.

Let's mint bob 100 DAI (in testnet, minting is open for anyone to call).&#x20;

```javascript
await dai.mint(bob, web3.utils.toWei("100", "ether"), { from: bob })

# Check bob's balance
(async () => (wad4human(await dai.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '100.00000'
```

Now bob has some **normal** DAI.

Before we can use DAI with Superfluid, we need to **upgrade** it to the Superfluid version "DAIx".

This is done using a `SuperToken` wrapper contract. Generally, there is a single wrapper for each ERC20.

Because we previously got the daix object when initializing the contract, we can now upgrade 50 of bob's DAI by calling `approve()` followed by `upgrade()`

```javascript
dai.approve(daix.address, "1"+"0".repeat(42), { from: bob })

daix.upgrade(web3.utils.toWei("50", "ether"), { from: bob })

```

### Check Balances

```javascript
(async () => (wad4human(await daix.balanceOf(bob))))()
> '50.00000'
```

Hurrah, we now have 50 Superfluid-enabled DAI or "DAIx". We are ready to start using Superfluid.
