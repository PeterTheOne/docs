# xDAI Chain

To use Superfluid with xDAI chain, you'll need a RPC URL to connect your metamask or application to a xDAI node.

> If you want to learn more about xDAI network, such as websocket connections, the full documentation is here: [https://www.xdaichain.com/](https://www.xdaichain.com)

_Easy button coming soon_! Until then, you'll need to add this information manually to Metamask. Click the network button at the top and select **Custom RPC**.
