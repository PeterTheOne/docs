# ðŸ¤– Running a Sentinel

### Running a Sentinel

Sentinels are the key player observing the network, and closing streams. They could be operating as Patrician, Pirates, or even just watching! The system is permissionless, and anyone can close streams by monitoring and interacting directly with the blockchain.

For convenience, you can also run our reference implementation of sentinel software, which has settings for all most common use-cases, and is fully open source. The readme in the [Superfluid-Sentinel repository](https://github.com/superfluid-finance/superfluid-sentinel) is the most up to date source on how to get started!
