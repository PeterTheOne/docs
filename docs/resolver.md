# Resolver

The Resolver is a helper contract which allows quickly finding all the contract addresses for the Superfluid Framework. You can think of it as the gateway to Superfluid.

The resolver is always deployed when the protocol is deployed. You've probably used it already and didn't know it, since this is what the `@superfluid-finance/js-sdk` uses each time you call `sf.initialize()`.

In this video I explain the Resolver using a visual programming platform called Eth.Build
